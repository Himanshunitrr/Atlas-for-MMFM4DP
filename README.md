## 🌟 About This Project

**Atlas-for-MMFM4DP** (Multimodal Foundational Models for Digital Pathology) is the **first and only** exhaustive visual guide that organizes the rapidly evolving ecosystem of multimodal AI models specifically tailored for digital pathology.

This project presents a simple, **interactive website** (in the form of a **mind map**) that comprehensively lists:

- ✅ **All existing models** related to multimodal learning in digital pathology
- ✅ **Categorization of models** based on **task types** like Classification, Segmentation, Prediction, Generation, Retrieval, and Diagnostic VQA
- ✅ **Datasets** associated with training and benchmarking these models
- ✅ **Direct visual mapping** of how models relate to each task and dataset
- ✅ **Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Supervised, and Weakly Supervised** task divisions

It is **exhaustive**, **organized**, and **one-of-a-kind** — serving researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in understanding or navigating the intersection of foundational models and computational pathology.

> _"If multimodal foundation models are the future of pathology, MMFM4DP is your atlas."_
